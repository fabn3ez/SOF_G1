HealthConnect is a web-based healthcare management system for Riverside Community Health Network,
 designed to streamline clinic operations, appointment scheduling, and patient communication. 
 It supports four user roles—patients, staff, doctors, and administrators—offering secure,
role-based access to features like booking, reminders, reporting,
and medical record management.

The system replaces inefficient paper-based and manual processes with a unified digital platform,
reducing administrative overhead, missed appointments, and patient wait times. 
Built with PHP, MySQL, and modern web technologies, HealthConnect provides responsive interfaces, 
automated notifications, and real-time analytics.

Key modules include authentication, appointment management, patient and staff portals, 
doctor features, and administration tools. Security is enforced through encryption, 
prepared statements, and session management. The system is tested for reliability, 
performance, and usability, achieving high user satisfaction and operational improvements.

Deployment requires a standard LAMP stack and includes setup scripts for different roles.
 Regular backups, security updates, and maintenance are planned, with future enhancements 
 targeting mobile apps, telemedicine, EHR integration, and AI-powered scheduling.

HealthConnect delivers significant improvements in efficiency, satisfaction, and data-driven management for clinics, 
with recommendations for ongoing development and scalability.
